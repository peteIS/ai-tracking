# Tracking Scenario
## Objective

Create a system/mechanism which completed several important parts of a tracking process with a drone. For the given task our system needed to be initiated by either an RF related lock access attack which initiated two specific phases of a tracking scenario. The RF lock attack scenario would activate a RF controlled camera which would drive up to the given room, this said camera would then begin taking images of an individual which accessed the locked door. The next step of the plan is to then take the images and upload them into a pre-trained model which would allow for facial tracking capabilities to be enabled into a program. The program would then begin controlling a drone which would seek out the accessed door and search and track the target within the previously uploaded images.
